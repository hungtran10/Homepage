    Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hung Tran, and I will be using this website to showcase some of the work I have done. I am a first-year M.S. in Data Science and Analytics student at Georgetown University. I graduated with a B.S. in Commerce (concentrations in Finance & IT, with a track in Business Analytics) from the University in Virginia. Go Hoos!

    I enjoy analyzing life through a business lens as I believe it is a powerful catalyst for change. My past internships have allowed me the opportunities to collaborate, communicate and problem solve via research and recommendation. For my first full-time job, I look forward to being in a role where I can combine my business acumen with my burgeoning technical skills to harness data for impactful decision-making. 

    My personal interests and hobbies are fragrances, watching the Premier League and FC Barcelona, cooking, pickleball, and going to the gym. 

    You can reach me at <mt1584@georgetown.edu> for any inquiries. Please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungtran8/) for a more comprehensive overview of my professional and academic career, and send me a request if you'd like to connect!
