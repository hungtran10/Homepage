Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hung Tran, and I will be using this website to showcase some of the work I have done.

## Educational Background
I am a first-year M.S. in Data Science and Analytics student at Georgetown University. I graduated with a B.S. in Commerce (concentrations in Finance & IT, with a track in Business Analytics) from the University in Virginia. Go Hoos!

## Career Aspirations
I enjoy analyzing life through a business lens as I believe it is a powerful catalyst for change. My past internships have allowed me the opportunities to collaborate, communicate and problem solve via research and recommendation. For my first full-time job, I look forward to being in a role where I can combine my business acumen with my burgeoning technical skills to harness data for impactful decision-making. 

## Hobbies and Interests
My personal interests and hobbies are fragrances, watching the Premier League and FC Barcelona, cooking, pickleball, and going to the gym.
