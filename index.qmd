# About Me
![](assets/Headshot1.JPG){width=300}

I am a first-year M.S. in Data Science and Analytics student at Georgetown University. I graduated with a B.S. in Commerce (Finance, IT, and Business Analytics) from the University in Virginia. Go Hoos!

I enjoy analyzing life through a business lens as I believe it is a powerful catalyst for change. My past internships have allowed me the opportunities to collaborate, communicate and problem solve via research and recommendation. For my first full-time job, I look forward to be in a role where I can combine my business acumen with my burgeoning technical skills to harness data for impactful decision making. 

My personal interests and hobbies are fragrances, watching the Premier League and FC Barcelona, cooking, pickleball, and going to the gym. 

You can reach me at <mt1584@georgetown.edu> for any inquiries. Please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hungtran8/) for a more comprehensive overview on my professional and academic career, and send me a request if you'd like to connect!
